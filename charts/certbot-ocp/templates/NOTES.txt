Get started with certbot

Annotate route (route.openshift.io/v1) with label letsencrypt-me=true
oc label route YOUR_ROUTE letsencrypt-me=true

If you need to re-run certbot Pod you can delete existing pod
oc delete po RELEASE_NAME-certbot-ocp 

And then upgrade existing deployment
helm upgrade RELEASE_NAME certbot-ocp
